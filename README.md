Project Name 

 

Renewable Energy Generating System. 

Project Summary 

The project aims to develop a renewable energy system with a solar panel and windmill connected to an LED and a battery to store energy. The solar panel transforms sunlight into electricity, which powers the LED throughout the day, and a battery to store the electricity to be used at night. Similarly, the windmill uses wind energy to generate power, lighting an LED when the wind blows. 

 

Project Capabilities  

. The Project can generate electricity using solar and wind energy, ensuring a continuous  

power supply throughout the day and night, depending on weather conditions.  
.  The project can be expanded by installing additional solar panels or windmills to boost energy generation capacity.  
.  The project has a beneficial environmental impact because it reduces carbon emissions from conventional power sources.  

.  This project can be used as a teaching tool highlighting the fundamentals of renewable energy generation and sustainability. 

.    The system includes a battery to store energy, an inductor, and resistors ensuring a continuous power supply when it is dark or wind-free.

Roles 

We all worked together to complete the project, but if we’re going into details what each person did: 

 

Modi made the circuit for the LED of the house and soldered it.   

Dara built the House for the solar system and 3d printing for the fans. 

Shammah built and soldered the windmill.
